#' Softmax converts a vector of values to a probability distribution.
#'
#' @description
#' The elements of the output vector are in range `[0, 1]` and sum to 1.
#'
#' Each input vector is handled independently.
#' The `axis` argument sets which axis of the input the function
#' is applied along.
#'
#' Softmax is often used as the activation for the last
#' layer of a classification network because the result could be interpreted as
#' a probability distribution.
#'
#' The softmax of each vector x is computed as
#' `exp(x) / sum(exp(x))`.
#'
#' The input values in are the log-odds of the resulting probability.
#'
#' @param x
#' Input tensor.
#'
#' @param axis
#' Integer, axis along which the softmax is applied.

Calculate the n-th discrete difference along the given axis.

@description
The first difference is given by `out[i] = a[i+1] - a[i]` along
the given axis, higher differences are calculated by using `diff`
recursively.

# Examples
```{r}
x <- k_ones(5)
ops_diff(x)
# [1, 1, 1, 1]

ops_diff(x, n = 2)
# [0, 0, 0]

x <- k_ones(c(2, 4))
ops_diff(x)
# [[1, 1, 1],
#  [5, 1, 2]]

ops_diff(x, axis = 1)
# [[-1, 2, 0, -2]]
```

@returns
Tensor of diagonals.

@param a Input tensor.
@param n The number of times values are differenced. Defaults to `1`.
@param axis Axis to compute discrete difference(s) along.
    Defaults to `-1` (last axis).

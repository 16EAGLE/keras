Calculate the n-th discrete difference along the given axis.

@description
The first difference is given by `out[i] = a[i+1] - a[i]` along
the given axis, higher differences are calculated by using `diff`
recursively.

# Examples
```{r}
x <- k_array(c(1, 2, 4, 7, 0))
k_diff(x)
k_diff(x, n = 2)
x <- k_array(rbind(c(1, 3, 6, 10), 
                  c(0, 5, 6, 8)))
k_diff(x)
k_diff(x, axis = 1)
```

@returns
Tensor of diagonals.

@param a Input tensor.
@param n The number of times values are differenced. Defaults to `1`.
@param axis Axis to compute discrete difference(s) along.
    Defaults to `-1` (last axis).

Repeat `x` the number of times given by `repeats`.

@description
If `repeats` has length `d`, the result will have dimension of
`max(d, x.ndim)`.

If `x.ndim < d`, `x` is promoted to be d-dimensional by prepending
new axes.

If `x.ndim > d`, `repeats` is promoted to `x.ndim` by prepending 1's to it.

@returns
    The tiled output tensor.

@param x
Input tensor.

@param repeats
The number of repetitions of `x` along each axis.

Split a tensor into chunks.

@description

# Note
A split does not have to result in equal division when using
Torch backend.

@returns
    A list of tensors.

@param x
Input tensor.

@param indices_or_sections
Either an integer indicating the number of
    sections along `axis` or a list of integers indicating the indices
    along `axis` at which the tensor is split.
If an integer, N, the tensor will be split into N
    equal sections along `axis`. If a 1-D array of sorted integers,
    the entries indicate indices at which the tensor will be split
    along `axis`.

@param axis
Axis along which to split. Defaults to `0`.

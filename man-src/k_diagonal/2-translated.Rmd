Return specified diagonals.

@description
If `x` is 2-D, returns the diagonal of `x` with the given offset, i.e., the
collection of elements of the form `x[i, i+offset]`.

If `x` has more than two dimensions, the axes specified by `axis1`
and `axis2` are used to determine the 2-D sub-array whose diagonal
is returned.

The shape of the resulting array can be determined by removing `axis1`
and `axis2` and appending an index to the right equal to the size of
the resulting diagonals.

# Examples
```{r}
x <- k_arange(4) |> k_reshape(c(2, 2))
x
k_diagonal(x)
k_diagonal(x, offset = 1)

x <- k_array(1:8) |> k_reshape(c(2, 2, 2))
x
k_diagonal(x, 0, 2)
```

Return a slice of an input tensor.

@description
At a high level, this operation is an explicit replacement for array slicing
e.g. `inputs[start_indices:(start_indices + shape)]`.
Unlike slicing via brackets, this operation will accept tensor start
indices on all backends, which is useful when indices dynamically computed
via other tensor operations.

```{r}
(inputs <- k_arange(5*5) |> k_reshape(c(5, 5)))
start_indices <- c(3, 3)
shape <- c(2, 2)
k_slice(inputs, start_indices, shape)
```

@returns
A tensor, has the same shape and dtype as `inputs`.

@param inputs
A tensor, the tensor to be sliced.

@param start_indices
A list of length `inputs$ndim`, specifying
the starting indices for updating.

@param shape
The full shape of the returned slice.

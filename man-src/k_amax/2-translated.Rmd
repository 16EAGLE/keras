Returns the maximum of a vector or maximum value along an axis.

@description

# Examples
```{r}
(x <- k_convert_to_tensor(rbind(c(1, 3, 5), c(1, 5, 2))))
k_amax(x)
k_amax(x, axis = 1)
k_amax(x, axis = 1, keepdims = TRUE)
```

@returns
A tensor with the maximum value. If `axis = NULL`, the result is a scalar
value representing the maximum element in the entire tensor. If `axis` is
given, the result is a tensor with the maximum values along
the specified axis.

@param x Input tensor.
@param axis Axis along which to compute the maximum.
    By default (`axis=NULL`), find the maximum value in all the
    dimensions of the input tensor.
@param keepdims If `TRUE`, axes which are reduced are left in the result as
    dimensions that are broadcast to the size of the original
    input tensor. Defaults to `FALSE`.

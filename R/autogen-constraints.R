r"-(MaxNorm weight constraint.

    Constrains the weights incident to each hidden unit
    to have a norm less than or equal to a desired value.

    Also available via the shortcut function `keras_core.constraints.max_norm`.

    Args:
        max_value: the maximum norm value for the incoming weights.
        axis: integer, axis along which to calculate weight norms.
            For instance, in a `Dense` layer the weight matrix
            has shape `(input_dim, output_dim)`,
            set `axis` to `0` to constrain each weight vector
            of length `(input_dim,)`.
            In a `Conv2D` layer with `data_format="channels_last"`,
            the weight tensor has shape
            `(rows, cols, input_depth, output_depth)`,
            set `axis` to `[0, 1, 2]`
            to constrain the weights of each filter tensor of size
            `(rows, cols, input_depth)`.

r"-(MinMaxNorm weight constraint.

    Constrains the weights incident to each hidden unit
    to have the norm between a lower bound and an upper bound.

    Args:
        min_value: the minimum norm for the incoming weights.
        max_value: the maximum norm for the incoming weights.
        rate: rate for enforcing the constraint: weights will be
            rescaled to yield
            `(1 - rate) * norm + rate * norm.clip(min_value, max_value)`.
            Effectively, this means that rate=1.0 stands for strict
            enforcement of the constraint, while rate<1.0 means that
            weights will be rescaled at each step to slowly move
            towards a value inside the desired interval.
        axis: integer, axis along which to calculate weight norms.

## Overview

TensorBoard is a visualization tool included with TensorFlow that enables you to visualize dynamic graphs of your Keras training and test metrics, as well as activation histograms for the different layers in your model. 

For example, here's a TensorBoard display for Keras accuracy and loss metrics:

## Recording Data

To record data that can be visualized with TensorBoard, you add a TensorBoard callback to the `fit()` function. For example:

```{r}
history <- model %>% fit(
  x_train, y_train,
  batch_size = batch_size,
  epochs = epochs,
  verbose = 1,
  callbacks = callback_tensorboard(log_dir = "logs/run_a"),
  validation_split = 0.2
)
```

See the documentation on the `callback_tensorboard()` function for the various available options. The most important option is the `log_dir`, which determines which directory logs are written to for a given training run. 

## Viewing Data

To view TensorBoard data for a given set of runs you use the `tensorboard()` function. If your training logs are located within the current working directory then you can call `tensorboard()` with no arguments:

```{r}
tensorboard()
```

If you alternatively want to specify a specific directory as the root of all training logs then you can use the `log_dir` parameter, for example:

```{r}
tensorboard(log_dir = "logs")
```

Note that you don't need to change the `log_dir` for each training run (the default log directory if none is specified is "logs"). In the case of a `log_dir` used multiple times TensorBoard will simply visualize the metrics for the most recent training run.

## Comparing Runs

TensorBoard will automatically include all runs logged within the sub-directories of the specified `log_dir`, for example, if you logged another run using:

```{r}
callback_tensorboard(log_dir = "logs/run_b")
```

Then the TensorBoard visualization would look like this:

![](tensorboard_compare.png){width=700 height=540 .screenshot}

You can use the `unique_log_dir` function if you want to record every training run in it's own directory:

```{r}
callback_tensorboard(log_dir = unique_log_dir())
```

Once again note that it's not required to record every training run in it's own directory. Using the default "logs" directory will work just fine, you'll just only be able to visualize the most recent run using TensorBoard.

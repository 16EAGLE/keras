\title{Compute the variance along the specified axes.}
\usage{
k_var(x, axis = NULL, keepdims = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input tensor.}

\item{axis}{Axis or axes along which the variance is computed. The default
is to compute the variance of the flattened tensor.}

\item{keepdims}{If this is set to \code{True}, the axes which are reduced are left
in the result as dimensions with size one.}

Compute the variance along the specified axes.

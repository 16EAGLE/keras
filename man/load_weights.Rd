\usage{
load_weights(model, filepath, by_name = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model to load weights into}

\item{filepath}{Path to the weights file to load.}

\item{by_name}{Whether to load weights by name or by topological order.}
}
\description{
Loads all layer weights from a HDF5 save file.
}
\details{
If \code{by_name} is \code{FALSE} (default) weights are loaded based on the
network's topology, meaning the architecture should be the same as when the
weights were saved. Note that layers that don't have weights are not taken
into account in the topological ordering, so adding or removing layers is
fine as long as they don't have weights.

If \code{by_name} is `TRUE``, weights are loaded into layers only if they share
the same name. This is useful for fine-tuning or transfer-learning models
where some of the layers have changed.

\title{Return the sum along diagonals of the tensor.}
\usage{
k_trace(x, offset = 0L, axis1 = 0L, axis2 = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input tensor.}

\item{offset}{Offset of the diagonal from the main diagonal. Can be
both positive and negative. Defaults to \code{0}.}

\item{axis1}{Axis to be used as the first axis of the 2-D sub-arrays.
Defaults to \code{0}.(first axis).}

\item{axis2}{Axis to be used as the second axis of the 2-D sub-arrays.
Defaults to \code{1} (second axis).}
}
\description{
If \code{x} is 2-D, the sum along its diagonal with the given offset is
returned, i.e., the sum of elements \code{x[i, i+offset]} for all \code{i}.

If a has more than two dimensions, then the axes specified by \code{axis1}
and \code{axis2} are used to determine the 2-D sub-arrays whose traces are
returned.

The shape of the resulting tensor is the same as that of \code{x} with \code{axis1}
and \code{axis2} removed.
}
\section{Returns}{
If \code{x} is 2-D, the sum of the diagonal is returned. If \code{x} has
larger dimensions, then a tensor of sums along diagonals is
returned.

\title{Return a tensor with ones at and below a diagonal and zeros elsewhere.}
\usage{
k_tri(N, M = NULL, k = 0L, dtype = "float32")
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Number of rows in the tensor.}

\item{M}{Number of columns in the tensor.}

\item{k}{The sub-diagonal at and below which the array is filled.
\code{k = 0} is the main diagonal, while \code{k < 0} is below it, and
\code{k > 0} is above. The default is 0.}

\item{dtype}{Data type of the returned tensor. The default is "float32".}
}
\description{
Return a tensor with ones at and below a diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
}
\section{Returns}{
Tensor with its lower triangle filled with ones and zeros elsewhere.
\code{T[i, j] == 1} for \code{j <= i + k}, 0 otherwise.

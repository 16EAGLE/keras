\title{Matrix product of two tensors.}
\usage{
k_matmul(x1, x2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{First tensor.}

\item{x2}{Second tensor.}
}
\description{
\itemize{
\item If both tensors are 1-dimensional, the dot product (scalar) is returned.
\item If either tensor is N-D, N > 2, it is treated as a stack of matrices
residing in the last two indexes and broadcast accordingly.
\item If the first tensor is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by prepending
a 1 to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication the prepended
1 is removed.
\item If the second tensor is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by appending a 1
to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication the appended 1 is removed.

\usage{
install_keras(method = c("auto", "virtualenv", "conda"),
  tensorflow = "default", conda = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Installation method. By default, "auto" automatically finds a
method that will work in the local environment. Change the default to force
a specific installation method. Note that the "virtualenv" method is not
available on Windows (as this isn't supported by TensorFlow) so "conda"
is the only supported method on windows.}

\item{tensorflow}{Named character vector of additional options to pass to
\code{\link[=install_tensorflow]{install_tensorflow()}}. If this argument is "default" then a previous
installation of TensorFlow will be used if available. Otherwise, a new
installation will be performed using the specified options.}

\item{conda}{Path to conda executable (or "auto" to find conda using the PATH
and other conventional install locations).}
}

Install Keras and the TensorFlow backend
}
\note{
If you want to do a more customized installation of TensorFlow
(including installing a version that takes advantage of Nvidia GPUs if you
have the correct CUDA libraries installed) you can pass additional options
to the \code{\link[=install_tensorflow]{install_tensorflow()}} function using the \code{tensorflow} argument.

If you want to do a fully custom installation of TensorFlow and
Keras using pip (e.g. a shared installation on a server) you can do that
and the keras R package will discover and use that version.

See the \href{https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation.html}{article on TensorFlow installation}
to learn about more advanced installation options.

# default installation
library(keras)
install_keras()

# install using a conda environment (default is virtualenv)
install_keras(method = "conda")

# install a specific version of TensorFlow
install_keras(tensorflow = c(version = "1.2.1"))

# install with GPU version of TensorFlow 
# (NOTE: only do this if you have an Nvidia GPU + CUDA!)
install_keras(tensorflow = c(gpu = TRUE))

\usage{
install_keras(
  ...,
  envname = "r-keras",
  extra_packages = NULL,
  python_version = "3.9",
  backend = c("tensorflow", "jax", "pytorch")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{other arguments passed to \code{\link[reticulate:conda-tools]{reticulate::conda_install()}} or
\code{\link[reticulate:virtualenv-tools]{reticulate::virtualenv_install()}}, depending on the \code{method} used.}

\item{envname}{The name, or full path, of the environment in which Python
packages are to be installed. When \code{NULL} (the default), the active
environment as set by the \code{RETICULATE_PYTHON_ENV} variable will be used;
if that is unset, then the \code{r-reticulate} environment will be used.}

\item{extra_packages}{Additional Python packages to install along with
TensorFlow.}

\item{tensorflow}{Synonym for \code{version}. Maintained for backwards.}
}
\description{
This function will install Tensorflow and all Keras dependencies. This is a
thin wrapper around \code{\link[tensorflow:install_tensorflow]{tensorflow::install_tensorflow()}}, with the only
difference being that this includes by default additional extra packages that
keras expects, and the default version of tensorflow installed by
\code{install_keras()} may at times be different from the default installed
\code{install_tensorflow()}. The default version of tensorflow installed by
\code{install_keras()} is "2.13".
}
\details{
The default additional packages are:
tensorflow-hub, tensorflow-datasets, scipy, requests, pyyaml, Pillow, h5py, pandas, pydot, with their
versions potentially constrained for compatibility with the
requested tensorflow version.

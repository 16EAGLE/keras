\usage{
install_keras(method = c("auto", "virtualenv", "conda", "system"),
  conda = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Installation method. By default, "auto" automatically finds a
method that will work in the local environment. Change the default to force
a specific installation method. Note that the "virtualenv" method is not
available on Windows (as this isn't supported by TensorFlow). Note also
that since this command runs without privillege the "system" method is
available only on Windows.}

\item{conda}{Path to conda executable (or "auto" to find conda using the PATH
and other conventional install locations).}

\note{
If you want to do a more customized installation of TensorFlow
(including installing a version that takes advantage of Nvidia GPUs if you
have the correct CUDA libraries installed) you can call the
\code{\link[=install_tensorflow]{install_tensorflow()}} function manually before calling \code{install_keras()}.
See the \href{https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation.html}{article on TensorFlow installation} to learn
about more advanced options.

\usage{
evaluate(model, x, y, batch_size = 32, verbose = 1, sample_weight = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model to train.}

\item{x}{Vector, matrix, or array of training data (or list if the model has
multiple inputs). If all inputs in the model are named, you can also pass a
list mapping input names to data.}

\item{y}{Vector, matrix, or array of target data (or list if the model has
multiple outputs). If all outputs in the model are named, you can also pass
a list mapping output names to data.}

\item{batch_size}{Number of samples per gradient update.}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity mode (0 = silent, 1 = verbose, 2 = one log line per
epoch).}

\item{sample_weight}{Optional array of the same length as x, containing
weights to apply to the model's loss for each sample. In the case of
temporal data, you can pass a 2D array with shape (samples,
sequence_length), to apply a different weight to every timestep of every
sample. In this case you should make sure to specify
sample_weight_mode="temporal" in \code{\link[=compile]{compile()}}.}
}
\value{
Scalar test loss (if the model has a single output and no metrics) or
list of scalars (if the model has multiple outputs and/or metrics).

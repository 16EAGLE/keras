\title{Apply a layer to every temporal slice of an input.}
\usage{
time_distributed(x, layer, input_shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Model or layer}

\item{layer}{A layer instance.}

\item{input_shape}{Dimensionality of the input (integer) not including the
samples axis. This argument is required when using this layer as the first
layer in a model.}
}
\description{
The input should be at least 3D, and the dimension of index one will be
considered to be the temporal dimension.
}
\details{
Consider a batch of 32 samples,  where each sample is a sequence of 10 vectors of 16 dimensions. The batch
input shape of the layer is then \code{(32, 10, 16)}, and the \code{input_shape}, not
including the samples dimension, is \code{(10, 16)}. You can then use
\code{time_distributed} to apply a \code{layer_dense} to each of the 10 timesteps,
independently.

\alias{set_random_seed}
\title{Sets all random seeds (Python, NumPy, and backend framework, e.g. TF).}
\usage{
set_random_seed(seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{Integer, the random seed to use.}
}
\description{
You can use this utility to make almost any Keras program fully
deterministic. Some limitations apply in cases where network communications
are involved (e.g. parameter server distribution), which creates additional
sources of randomness, or when certain non-deterministic cuDNN ops are
involved.

Calling this utility is equivalent to the following:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode python">}}\preformatted{import random
import numpy as np
from keras.utils.module_utils import tensorflow as tf
random.seed(seed)
np.random.seed(seed)
tf.random.set_seed(seed)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Note that the TensorFlow seed is set even if you're not using TensorFlow
as your backend framework, since many workflows leverage \code{tf.data}
pipelines (which feature random shuffling). Likewise many workflows
might leverage NumPy APIs.

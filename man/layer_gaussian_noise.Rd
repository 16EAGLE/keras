\title{Apply additive zero-centered Gaussian noise.}
\usage{
layer_gaussian_noise(x, stddev, input_shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Model or layer}

\item{stddev}{float, standard deviation of the noise distribution.}

\item{input_shape}{Dimensionality of the input (integer) not including the
samples axis. This argument is required when using this layer as the first
layer in a model.}
}
\description{
This is useful to mitigate overfitting (you could see it as a form of random
data augmentation). Gaussian Noise (GS) is a natural choice as corruption
process for real valued inputs. As it is a regularization layer, it is only
active at training time.
}
\section{Input shape}{
 Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument \code{input_shape} (list
of integers, does not include the samples axis) when using this layer as
the first layer in a model.
}

\section{Output shape}{
 Same shape as input.

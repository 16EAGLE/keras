\title{Apply additive zero-centered Gaussian noise.}
\usage{
layer_gaussian_noise(object, stddev, seed = NULL, ...)

layer_gaussian_noise(object, stddev, seed = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{stddev}{Float, standard deviation of the noise distribution.}

\item{seed}{Integer, optional random seed to enable deterministic behavior.}
}
\description{
This is useful to mitigate overfitting
(you could see it as a form of random data augmentation).
Gaussian Noise (GS) is a natural choice as corruption process
for real valued inputs.

As it is a regularization layer, it is only active at training time.

inputs: Input tensor (of any rank).
training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
training mode (adding noise) or in inference mode (doing nothing).

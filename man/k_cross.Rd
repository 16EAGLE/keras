\title{Returns the cross product of two (arrays of) vectors.}
\usage{
k_cross(x1, x2, axisa = -1L, axisb = -1L, axisc = -1L, axis = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{Components of the first vector(s).
x2: Components of the second vector(s).
axisa: Axis of \code{x1} that defines the vector(s). Defaults to \code{-1}.
axisb: Axis of \code{x2} that defines the vector(s). Defaults to \code{-1}.
axisc: Axis of the result containing the cross product vector(s).
Ignored if both input vectors have dimension 2, as the return is
scalar. By default, the last axis.
axis: If defined, the axis of \code{x1}, \code{x2} and the result that
defines the vector(s) and cross product(s). Overrides \code{axisa},
\code{axisb} and \code{axisc}.

Note:
Torch backend does not support two dimensional vectors, or the
arguments \code{axisa}, \code{axisb} and \code{axisc}. Use \code{axis} instead.}
}
\description{
The cross product of \code{x1} and \code{x2} in R^3 is a vector
perpendicular to both \code{x1} and \code{x2}. If \code{x1} and \code{x2} are arrays of
vectors, the vectors are defined by the last axis of \code{x1} and \code{x2}
by default, and these axes can have dimensions 2 or 3.

Where the dimension of either \code{x1} or \code{x2} is 2, the third component of
the input vector is assumed to be zero and the cross product calculated
accordingly.

In cases where both input vectors have dimension 2, the z-component of
the cross product is returned.

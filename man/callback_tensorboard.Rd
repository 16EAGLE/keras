\usage{
callback_tensorboard(log_dir = "./logs", histogram_freq = 0,
  write_graph = TRUE, write_images = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{log_dir}{the path of the directory where to save the log files to be
parsed by Tensorboard.}

\item{histogram_freq}{frequency (in epochs) at which to compute activation
histograms for the layers of the model. If set to 0, histograms won't be
computed.}

\item{write_graph}{whether to visualize the graph in Tensorboard. The log
file can become quite large when write_graph is set to \code{TRUE}}

\item{write_images}{whether to write model weights to visualize as image in
Tensorboard.}
}
\description{
This callback writes a log for TensorBoard, which allows you to visualize
dynamic graphs of your training and test metrics, as well as activation
histograms for the different layers in your model.
}
\details{
TensorBoard is a visualization tool provided with TensorFlow.

If you have installed TensorFlow with pip, you should be able to launch
TensorBoard from the command line:\preformatted{--logdir=/full_path_to_your_logs 
}

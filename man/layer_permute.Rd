\title{Permute the dimensions of an input according to a given pattern}
\usage{
layer_permute(x, dims, input_shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Model or layer}

\item{dims}{List of integers. Permutation pattern, does not include the
samples dimension. Indexing starts at 1. For instance, \code{(2, 1)} permutes
the first and second dimension of the input.}

\item{input_shape}{Input shape (list of integers, does not include the
samples axis) which is required when using this layer as the first layer in
a model.}
}
\description{
Permute the dimensions of an input according to a given pattern
}
\note{
Useful for e.g. connecting RNNs and convnets together.

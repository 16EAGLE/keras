\title{Spatial 1D version of Dropout.}
\usage{
layer_spatial_dropout_1d(object, rate, seed = NULL, name = NULL, dtype = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object to compose the layer with. A tensor, array, or sequential model.}

\item{rate}{Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.}

\item{seed}{Initial seed for the random number generator}

\item{name}{String, name for the object}

\item{dtype}{datatype (e.g., \code{"float32"}).}
}
\description{
This layer performs the same function as Dropout, however, it drops
entire 1D feature maps instead of individual elements. If adjacent frames
within feature maps are strongly correlated (as is normally the case in
early convolution layers) then regular dropout will not regularize the
activations and will otherwise just result in an effective learning rate
decrease. In this case, \code{SpatialDropout1D} will help promote independence
between feature maps and should be used instead.

\section{Call Arguments}{
\itemize{
\item \code{inputs}: A 3D tensor.
\item \code{training}: Python boolean indicating whether the layer
should behave in training mode (applying dropout)
or in inference mode (pass-through).
}
}

\section{Input Shape}{
3D tensor with shape: \verb{(samples, timesteps, channels)}
}

\section{Output Shape}{
Same as input.

\title{Global Average pooling operation for 3D data.}
\usage{
layer_global_average_pooling_3d(x, data_format = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Model or layer}

\item{data_format}{A string, one of \code{channels_last} (default) or
\code{channels_first}. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs.
\code{channels_last} corresponds to inputs with shape \code{(batch, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3, channels)} while \code{channels_first} corresponds
to inputs with shape \code{(batch, channels, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3)}. It defaults to the \code{image_data_format} value found in your
Keras config file at \code{~/.keras/keras.json}. If you never set it, then it
will be "channels_last".}

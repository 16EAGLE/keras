\usage{
compile(model, optimizer, loss, metrics = NULL, loss_weights = NULL,
  sample_weight_mode = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{loss}{Name of objective function or objective function. If the model
has multiple outputs, you can use a different loss on each output by
passing a dictionary or a list of objectives.}

\item{metrics}{List of metrics to be evaluated by the model during training
and testing. Typically you will use \code{metrics='accuracy'}. To specify
different metrics for different outputs of a multi-output model, you could
also pass a named list such as \code{metrics=list(output_a = 'accuracy')}.}

\item{sample_weight_mode}{If you need to do timestep-wise sample weighting
(2D weights), set this to "temporal". \code{NULL} defaults to sample-wise
weights (1D). If the model has multiple outputs, you can use a different
\code{sample_weight_mode} on each output by passing a list of modes.}

\item{optimizer:}{Name of optimizer or optimizer object.}
}

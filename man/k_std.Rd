\title{Compute the standard deviation along the specified axis.}
\usage{
k_std(x, axis = NULL, keepdims = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input tensor.}

Default is to compute the standard deviation of the
flattened tensor.}

\item{keepdims}{If this is set to \code{True}, the axes which are reduced are left
in the result as dimensions with size one.}

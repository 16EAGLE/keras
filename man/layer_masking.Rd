\title{Masks a sequence by using a mask value to skip timesteps.}
\usage{
layer_masking(x, mask_value = 0, input_shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Model or layer}

\item{mask_value}{float, mask value}

\item{input_shape}{Dimensionality of the input (integer) not including the
samples axis. This argument is required when using this layer as the first
layer in a model.}
}
\description{
For each timestep in the input tensor (dimension #1 in the tensor), if all
values in the input tensor at that timestep are equal to \code{mask_value}, then
the timestep will be masked (skipped) in all downstream layers (as long as
they support masking). If any downstream layer does not support masking yet
receives such an input mask, an exception will be raised.

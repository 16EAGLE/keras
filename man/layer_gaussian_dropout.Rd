\alias{layer_gaussian_dropout}
\title{Apply multiplicative 1-centered Gaussian noise.}
\usage{
layer_gaussian_dropout(object, rate, seed = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{Float, drop probability (as with \code{Dropout}).
The multiplicative noise will have
standard deviation \code{sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))}.}

\item{seed}{Integer, optional random seed to enable deterministic behavior.}
}
\description{
As it is a regularization layer, it is only active at training time.
}
\section{Call Arguments}{
\itemize{
\item \code{inputs}: Input tensor (of any rank).
\item \code{training}: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (doing nothing).
}

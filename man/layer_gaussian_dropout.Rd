\alias{layer_gaussian_dropout}
\title{Apply multiplicative 1-centered Gaussian noise.}
\usage{
layer_gaussian_dropout(x, rate, input_shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Model or layer}

\item{rate}{float, drop probability (as with \code{Dropout}). The multiplicative
noise will have standard deviation \code{sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))}.}

\item{input_shape}{Dimensionality of the input (integer) not including the
samples axis. This argument is required when using this layer as the first
layer in a model.}
}
\description{
As it is a regularization layer, it is only active at training time.
}
\section{Input shape}{
 Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument \code{input_shape} (list
of integers, does not include the samples axis) when using this layer as
the first layer in a model.
}

\section{Output shape}{
 Same shape as input.

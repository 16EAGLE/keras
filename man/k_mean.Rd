\title{Compute the arithmetic mean along the specified axes.}
\usage{
k_mean(x, axis = NULL, keepdims = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input tensor.}

is to compute the mean of the flattened tensor.}

\item{keepdims}{If this is set to \code{True}, the axes which are reduced are left
in the result as dimensions with size one.}

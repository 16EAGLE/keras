\title{Input layer}
\usage{
layer_input(shape = NULL, batch_shape = NULL, name = NULL,
  dtype = "float32", sparse = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{shape}{Shapes, not including the batch size. For instance,
\code{shape=c(32)} indicates that the expected input will be batches of
32-dimensional vectors.}

\item{batch_shape}{Shapes, including the batch size. For instance,
\code{batch_shape= c(10, 32)} indicates that the expected input will be batches
of 10 32-dimensional vectors. batch_shape=c(NULL, 32)` indicates batches of
an arbitrary number of 32-dimensional vectors.}

\item{name}{An optional name string for the layer. Should be unique in a
model (do not reuse the same name twice). It will be autogenerated if it
isn't provided.}

\item{dtype}{The data type expected by the input, as a string (\code{float32},
\code{float64}, \code{int32}...)}

\item{sparse}{Boolean, whether the placeholder created is meant to be sparse.}
}
\description{
Layer to be used as an entry point into a graph.
}
\details{
It can either wrap an existing tensor (pass an \code{input_tensor}
argument) or create its a placeholder tensor (pass arguments \code{input_shape}
or \code{batch_input_shape} as well as \code{input_dtype}).

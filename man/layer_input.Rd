\title{Used to instantiate a Keras tensor.}
\usage{
layer_input(
  shape = NULL,
  batch_size = NULL,
  dtype = NULL,
  sparse = NULL,
  batch_shape = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  tensor = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shape}{A shape tuple (tuple of integers or \code{None} objects),
not including the batch size.
For instance, \verb{shape=(32,)} indicates that the expected input
will be batches of 32-dimensional vectors. Elements of this tuple
can be \code{None}; \code{None} elements represent dimensions where the shape
is not known and may vary (e.g. sequence length).}

\item{batch_size}{Optional static batch size (integer).}

\item{dtype}{The data type expected by the input, as a string
(e.g. \code{"float32"}, \code{"int32"}...)}

\item{sparse}{A boolean specifying whether the expected input will be sparse
tensors. Note that, if \code{sparse} is \code{False}, sparse tensors can still
be passed into the input - they will be densified with a default
value of 0. This feature is only supported with the TensorFlow
backend. Defaults to \code{False}.}

\item{name}{Optional name string for the layer.
Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice).
It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided.}

\item{tensor}{Optional existing tensor to wrap into the \code{Input} layer.
If set, the layer will use this tensor rather
than creating a new placeholder tensor.}
}
\description{
A Keras tensor is a symbolic tensor-like object, which we augment with
certain attributes that allow us to build a Keras model just by knowing the
inputs and outputs of the model.

For instance, if \code{a}, \code{b} and \code{c} are Keras tensors,
it becomes possible to do:
\verb{model = Model(input=[a, b], output=c)}
}

\usage{
save_model(model, filepath, overwrite = TRUE)

load_model(filepath, custom_objects = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model to save}

\item{filepath}{File path}

\item{overwrite}{Overwrite existing file if necessary}

\item{custom_objects}{Mapping class names (or function names) of custom
(non-Keras) objects to class/functions}
}
\description{
Save/Load models using HDF5 files
}
\details{
The following components of the model are saved:
\itemize{
\item The model architecture, allowing to re-instantiate the model.
\item The model weights.
\item The state of the optimizer, allowing to resume training exactly where you
left off.
This allows you to save the entirety of the state of a model
in a single file.
}

Saved models can be reinstantiated via \code{load_model()}. The model returned by
\code{load_model()} is a compiled model ready to be used (unless the saved model
was never compiled in the first place).

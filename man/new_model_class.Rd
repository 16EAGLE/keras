\arguments{
\item{classname}{String, the name of the custom class. (Conventionally, CamelCase).}

\item{..., public}{Additional methods or public members of the custom class.
Recommended methods \code{initialize}, \code{call} can optionally be
provided as elements of \code{public}, and will take precedence over the value
supplied to the argument.}

\item{private}{Named list of R objects (typically, functions) to include in
instance private environments. \code{private} will be a symbol in scope in all
class methods, resolving to an R environment populated with the list
provided. Each instance will have it's own \code{private} environment. All
methods (functions) in \code{private} will have in scope \code{self} and \verb{__class__}
symbols. Any objects in \code{private} will be invisible from the Keras
framework and the Python runtime.}

\item{inherit}{What the custom class will subclass. By default, the base keras class.}

\item{parent_env}{The R environment that all class methods will have as a grandparent.}
}

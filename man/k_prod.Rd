\title{Return the product of tensor elements over a given axis.}
\usage{
k_prod(x, axis = NULL, keepdims = FALSE, dtype = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input tensor.}

\item{axis}{Axis or axes along which a product is performed. The default,
\code{axis=None}, will compute the product of all elements
in the input tensor.}

\item{keepdims}{If this is set to \code{True}, the axes which are reduce
are left in the result as dimensions with size one.}

\item{dtype}{Data type of the returned tensor.}
}

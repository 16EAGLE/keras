\title{Set the random seed for a Keras session}
\usage{
set_keras_seed(seed, disable_gpu = TRUE, disable_parallel_cpu = TRUE,
  quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{A single value, interpreted as an integer}

\item{disable_gpu}{\code{TRUE} to disable GPU execution (see \emph{Parallelism} below).}

\item{disable_parallel_cpu}{\code{TRUE} to disable CPU parallelism (see
\emph{Parallelism} below).}

\item{quiet}{\code{TRUE} to suppress printing of messages.}
}
\value{
Keras session object, invisibly
}
\description{
Set various random seeds required to ensure reproducible results. The
provided \code{seed} value will establish a new random seed for R, Python, NumPy,
and TensorFlow (when it is the active Keras backend). GPU and CPU parallelism
will also be disabled by default.
}
\details{
This function must be called at the very top of your script
(i.e. immediately after \code{library(keras)}).
}
\section{Parallelism}{
 By default the \code{set_keras_seed()} function
disables GPU and CPU parallelism, since both can result in
non-determinisitc execution patterns (see
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42022950/}). You can optionally enable
GPU or CPU parallelism by setting the \code{disable_gpu} and/or
\code{disable_parallel_cpu} parameters to \code{FALSE}. Note that CPU parallelism is
currently disabled only for the "tensorflow" back-end (additional
investigation is required to determine how to disable CPU parallelism for
other backends).

\usage{
layer_activation_parametric_relu(x, alpha_initializer = "zeros",
  alpha_regularizer = NULL, alpha_constraint = NULL, shared_axes = NULL,
  input_shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Model or layer}

\item{alpha_initializer}{Initializer function for the weights.}

\item{alpha_regularizer}{Regularizer for the weights.}

\item{alpha_constraint}{Constraint for the weights.}

\item{shared_axes}{The axes along which to share learnable parameters for the
activation function. For example, if the incoming feature maps are from a
2D convolution with output shape (batch, height, width, channels), and you
wish to share parameters across space so that each filter only has one set
of parameters, set shared_axes=c(1, 2).}

\item{input_shape}{Input shape (list of integers, does not include the
samples axis) which is required when using this layer as the first layer in
a model.}
}
\description{
It follows: \code{f(x) = alpha * x`` for}x < 0\code{,}f(x) = x\code{for}x >= 0`, where
alpha is a learned array with the same shape as x.

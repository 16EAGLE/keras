\title{Instantiates the ResNet152 architecture.}
\usage{
application_resnet152(
  include_top = TRUE,
  weights = "imagenet",
  input_tensor = NULL,
  input_shape = NULL,
  pooling = NULL,
  classes = 1000L,
  classifier_activation = "softmax"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{include_top}{whether to include the fully-connected
layer at the top of the network.}

\item{weights}{one of \code{None} (random initialization),
\code{"imagenet"} (pre-training on ImageNet), or the path to the weights
file to be loaded.}

\item{input_tensor}{optional Keras tensor (i.e. output of \code{layers.Input()})
to use as image input for the model.}

\item{input_shape}{optional shape tuple, only to be specified if \code{include_top}
is \code{False} (otherwise the input shape has to be \verb{(224, 224, 3)}
(with \code{"channels_last"} data format) or \verb{(3, 224, 224)}
(with \code{"channels_first"} data format). It should have exactly 3
inputs channels, and width and height should be no smaller than 32.
E.g. \verb{(200, 200, 3)} would be one valid value.}

\item{pooling}{Optional pooling mode for feature extraction when \code{include_top}
is \code{False}.
- \code{None} means that the output of the model will be the 4D tensor
output of the last convolutional block.
- \code{avg} means that global average pooling will be applied to the output
of the last convolutional block, and thus the output of the
model will be a 2D tensor.
- \code{max} means that global max pooling will be applied.}

\item{classes}{optional number of classes to classify images into, only to be
specified if \code{include_top} is \code{True}, and if no \code{weights} argument is
specified.}

\item{classifier_activation}{A \code{str} or callable. The activation function to
use on the "top" layer. Ignored unless \code{include_top=True}. Set
\code{classifier_activation=None} to return the logits of the "top" layer.
When loading pretrained weights, \code{classifier_activation} can only
be \code{None} or \code{"softmax"}.}

For image classification use cases, see \href{https://keras.io/api/applications/#usage-examples-for-image-classification-models}{this page for detailed examples}.

For transfer learning use cases, make sure to read the
\href{https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/}{guide to transfer learning & fine-tuning}.

Note: each Keras Application expects a specific kind of input preprocessing.
For ResNet, call \code{keras_core.applications.resnet.preprocess_input} on your
inputs before passing them to the model. \code{resnet.preprocess_input} will convert
the input images from RGB to BGR, then will zero-center each color channel with
respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling.

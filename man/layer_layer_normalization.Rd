\arguments{
\item{axis}{Integer or List/Tuple. The axis or axes to normalize across.
Typically, this is the features axis/axes. The left-out axes are
typically the batch axis/axes. \code{-1} is the last dimension in the
input. Defaults to \code{-1}.}

\item{epsilon}{Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero.
Defaults to 1e-3.}

\item{center}{If True, add offset of \code{beta} to normalized tensor. If False,
\code{beta} is ignored. Defaults to \code{True}.}

\item{scale}{If True, multiply by \code{gamma}. If False, \code{gamma} is not used.
When the next layer is linear (also e.g. \code{nn.relu}), this can be
disabled since the scaling will be done by the next layer.
Defaults to \code{True}.}

\item{rms_scaling}{If True, \code{center} and \code{scale} are ignored, and the
inputs are scaled by \code{gamma} and the inverse square root
of the square of all inputs. This is an approximate and faster
approach that avoids ever computing the mean of the input.}

\item{beta_initializer}{Initializer for the beta weight. Defaults to zeros.}

\item{gamma_initializer}{Initializer for the gamma weight. Defaults to ones.}

\item{beta_regularizer}{Optional regularizer for the beta weight.
None by default.}

\item{gamma_regularizer}{Optional regularizer for the gamma weight.
None by default.}

\item{beta_constraint}{Optional constraint for the beta weight.
None by default.}

\item{gamma_constraint}{Optional constraint for the gamma weight.
None by default.}

\item{...}{Base layer keyword arguments (e.g. \code{name} and \code{dtype}).}

\description{
Normalize the activations of the previous layer for each given example in a
batch independently, rather than across a batch like Batch Normalization.
i.e. applies a transformation that maintains the mean activation within each
example close to 0 and the activation standard deviation close to 1.

If \code{scale} or \code{center} are enabled, the layer will scale the normalized
outputs by broadcasting them with a trainable variable \code{gamma}, and center
the outputs by broadcasting with a trainable variable \code{beta}. \code{gamma} will
default to a ones tensor and \code{beta} will default to a zeros tensor, so that
centering and scaling are no-ops before training has begun.

So, with scaling and centering enabled the normalization equations
are as follows:

Let the intermediate activations for a mini-batch to be the \code{inputs}.

For each sample \code{x_i} in \code{inputs} with \code{k} features, we compute the mean and
variance of the sample:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode python">}}\preformatted{mean_i = sum(x_i[j] for j in range(k)) / k
var_i = sum((x_i[j] - mean_i) ** 2 for j in range(k)) / k
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

and then compute a normalized \code{x_i_normalized}, including a small factor
\code{epsilon} for numerical stability.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode python">}}\preformatted{x_i_normalized = (x_i - mean_i) / sqrt(var_i + epsilon)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

And finally \code{x_i_normalized } is linearly transformed by \code{gamma} and \code{beta},
which are learned parameters:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode python">}}\preformatted{output_i = x_i_normalized * gamma + beta
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

\code{gamma} and \code{beta} will span the axes of \code{inputs} specified in \code{axis}, and
this part of the inputs' shape must be fully defined.

For example:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode python">}}\preformatted{layer = keras_core.layers.LayerNormalization(axis=[1, 2, 3])
layer.build([5, 20, 30, 40])
print(layer.beta.shape)
# (20, 30, 40)
print(layer.gamma.shape)
# (20, 30, 40)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Note that other implementations of layer normalization may choose to define
\code{gamma} and \code{beta} over a separate set of axes from the axes being
normalized across. For example, Group Normalization
(\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494}{Wu et al. 2018}) with group size of 1
corresponds to a Layer Normalization that normalizes across height, width,
and channel and has \code{gamma} and \code{beta} span only the channel dimension.
So, this Layer Normalization implementation will not match a Group
Normalization layer with group size set to 1.

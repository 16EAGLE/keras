\description{
This is an implementation of multi-headed attention as described in the
paper "Attention is all you Need"
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762}{Vaswani et al., 2017}.
If \code{query}, \verb{key,} \code{value} are the same, then
this is self-attention. Each timestep in \code{query} attends to the
corresponding sequence in \code{key}, and returns a fixed-width vector.

This layer first projects \code{query}, \code{key} and \code{value}. These are
(effectively) a list of tensors of length \code{num_attention_heads}, where the
corresponding shapes are \verb{(batch_size, <query dimensions>, key_dim)},
\verb{(batch_size, <key/value dimensions>, key_dim)},
\verb{(batch_size, <key/value dimensions>, value_dim)}.

Then, the query and key tensors are dot-producted and scaled. These are
softmaxed to obtain attention probabilities. The value tensors are then
interpolated by these probabilities, then concatenated back to a single
tensor.

Finally, the result tensor with the last dimension as \code{value_dim} can take
a linear projection and return.

\section{Call Arguments}{
query: Query tensor of shape \verb{(B, T, dim)}, where \code{B} is the batch size,
\code{T} is the target sequence length, and dim is the feature dimension.
value: Value tensor of shape \verb{(B, S, dim)}, where \code{B} is the batch size,
\code{S} is the source sequence length, and dim is the feature dimension.
key: Optional key tensor of shape \verb{(B, S, dim)}. If not given, will
use \code{value} for both \code{key} and \code{value}, which is the most common
case.
attention_mask: a boolean mask of shape \verb{(B, T, S)}, that prevents
attention to certain positions. The boolean mask specifies which
query elements can attend to which key elements, 1 indicates
attention and 0 indicates no attention. Broadcasting can happen for
the missing batch dimensions and the head dimension.
return_attention_scores: A boolean to indicate whether the output should
be \verb{(attention_output, attention_scores)} if \code{True}, or
\code{attention_output} if \code{False}. Defaults to \code{False}.
training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (no dropout).
Will go with either using the training mode of the parent
layer/model, or \code{False} (inference) if there is no parent layer.
use_causal_mask: A boolean to indicate whether to apply a causal mask to
prevent tokens from attending to future tokens (e.g., used in a
decoder Transformer).
}

\section{Returns}{
attention_output: The result of the computation, of shape \verb{(B, T, E)},
where \code{T} is for target sequence shapes and \code{E} is the query input
last dimension if \code{output_shape} is \code{None}. Otherwise, the
multi-head outputs are projected to the shape specified by
\code{output_shape}.
attention_scores: (Optional) multi-head attention coefficients over
attention axes.

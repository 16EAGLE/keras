## R interface to Keras

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high-level neural networks API developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. *Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.* 

Keras has the following key features:

- It allows the same code to run on CPU or on GPU, seamlessly.

- It has a user-friendly API which makes it easy to quickly prototype deep learning models.

- It has build-in support for convolutional networks (for computer vision), recurrent networks (for sequence processing), and any combination of both.

- It supports arbitrary network architectures: multi-input or multi-output models, layer sharing, model sharing, etc. This means that Keras is appropriate for building essentially any deep learning model, from a memory network to a neural Turing machine.

Description: Interface to 'Keras' (https://keras.io), a high-level neural 
  networks API which runs on top of 'TensorFlow' (https://www.tensorflow.org).
  'Keras' was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation, 
  supports both convolution based networks and recurrent networks (as well as
  combinations of the two), and runs seamlessly on both 'CPU' and 'GPU' 
  devices.
